# Slowmode Compatibility

## Desktop
Slowmode is fully compatible with all of the latest Discord desktop versions: Stable, PTB, and Canary.

## iOS
Slowmode is not fully compatible with the stable version, as support was added in 2.3.8 build 7106. Slowmode is fully compatible with the latest TestFlight build.

## Android
Slowmode is fully compatible with the latest Android Alpha build, however compatibility information is not known for Stable and Beta.

**Note:** In compatible clients, it will display a countdown until they can send the next message. In incompatible clients, it will queue up the messages and send each at a time when the timer runs out.
